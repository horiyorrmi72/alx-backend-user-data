Understanding the Code:

The first line #!/usr/bin/env python3 is like a magical command that tells the computer to use Python to understand the code.
The note inside triple quotes ("""Module Regex-ing - handling user data""") is like a brief description of what the code does. It's like a title for our tool.
The code uses some helpers, like List (for making lists), logging (for keeping track of stuff), environ (for getting information about your computer environment), re (for working with patterns in text).
PII_FIELDS is like a list of secret things that need protection: names, passwords, phones, SSNs (social security numbers), and emails.
Protecting Secrets: 

Imagine you have secret words like "password" and "email." This function helps find those words in a message and makes them invisible.
You can tell the function what words to look for (like "password" or "email"), what to use to hide them (a secret code called redaction), the message with the secrets, and where the secrets end (a special sign called separator).
The function goes through the message, finds each secret, and swaps it with the secret code and separator. This way, no one can figure out the real secrets!
